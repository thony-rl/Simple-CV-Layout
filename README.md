# Simple Page Layout
This repository is an example of a simple web page based directly on the design.

It is designed to learn a little about Frontend programming and to use as a starter for future projects, since having a common and simple structure, the code can be easily adapted.

It has comments that try to explain what is used on each occasion, thus being able to study the code and have a source of knowledge for its own repositories.

This model is minimalist and can be adapted to Personal Portfolios.
